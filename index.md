## Welcome to SusSH

SusSH is a sussy serious parody of Bash, not exactly though. It can be used as both terminal emulator and a "Reverse" Shell.
Apparently SusSH is under _**DEVELOPMENT**_

### About SusSH

As you already read above (or atleast what I hope you did), it is a reverse shell tool.
**PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES** (or you can use it on others if you have **EXPLICIT** permission)
